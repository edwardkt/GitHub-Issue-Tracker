GitHub Issue Tracker
====================
This is a chrome extension tool that I created to keep track of the latest 15 unique issues on github. 

Installation
============
1. Download the zip file and launch chrome.
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions/
3. Check Developer mode checkbox on top right
4. click on Load unpacked extension and have chrome point to the root directory of the extension folder
5. You will now see an extension icon on the top right side of the browser
6. Navigate to some issues. You will have to navigate to an issue thats in this format https://github.com/username/repo_name/issues/issue_number in order for the tool to track the issues you navigated to.
